Improvements Notes: 
- Make the README and Getting Started coherence. No instructions for installing cargo. I guess also on how to use Lean in codespaces. 
- Update the elan installer to work as the rust installer to have easier use in Codespaces. 
- cargo install just is needed
- Installed cargo using https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
